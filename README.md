# Protect Kids Not Guns

Gun bans and gun control have always been controversial topics, and with the continued occurrence of school shootings, this topic has been raised repeatedly.

I am growing up in China, guns are very strictly controlled in my country, and gun violence is even less likely to occur in schools. In 2021, I got a part-time job as an art teacher at a private elementary school, and we had to conduct gun violence drills to educate elementary school students on how to face these problems that may occur. 
But, I feel sad. 
I took the insprirations from 2012,Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting event and another massacre shooting at the Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, 2022.

So I made this educational purpose project. I hope those gun shot victims will never be forgotten. 
Also, I hope kids can live in a not gun, not violence environment.



# Function
This is an interactive web-based game simulating gun shooting. I utilized a particle system function on page two to process the victim image. When user mouse hover the screen, particals will spreading out with user's mouse but will garthing back. The story text will appear under the partical. My purpose in here is to simulate an effect as a scar.
These tragedies may be covered up over time, but they remain, like scars.
and employed Object-Oriented Programming to organize the pages. When the user presses the mouse, it will navigate to the next page, and the shooting sound can play.

Also, I used the time millis function to control the image fade-in and fade-out effects.
